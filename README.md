<h1 align="center">Product StoreðŸš€</h1>
<h2>My name is Pavan kumar, and I have developed a fully functional e-commerce product store application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). This application provides  allowing users to browse through products, view detailed information and  add items to their cart. The front end, built with React, ensures a user-friendly and responsive interface, while the back end, powered by Node.js and Express. MongoDB serves as the database, efficiently handling user data, product inventories, and order histories. This project demonstrates my ability to integrate front-end and back-end technologies to create a seamless, dynamic e-commerce solution.</h2>
